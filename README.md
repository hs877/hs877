My name is Hrishi, and I am currently earning my Bachelor’s in Aerospace Engineering at Rutgers University (New Brunswick) and seeking admission to Ph.D. programs in Mechanical Engineering. My research background is in robotics and control systems. I am currently tackling problems on stabilizing underactuated systems, tire-ground interactions, and developing novel designs to tackle a wide range of real-world applications. I have been a research assistant at the Rutgers Robotics, Automation, and Mechatronics (RAM) Laboratory for the past two years. I am driven to provide the best quality of research in the field of autonomous systems, and more importantly, I am passionate about learning more about this field through rigorous experimentation and applied learning.
